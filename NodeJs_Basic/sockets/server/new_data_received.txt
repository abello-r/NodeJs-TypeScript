To fix the problem described above,
we need a mechanism with which we can divide large amounts of data into small chunks.
We will also need data structures to store these chunks and work with them.
A buffer is a data structure that allows you to store binary data. Next,
we must be able to read data from disk and write it to disk. This opportunity can give us flows.
Let's talk about buffers and threads.
